  	     <h5>im gonna go back to my horoscopie bestie again cus i always do this anyway in the morning so i'll just do this for now because it's nice so it said u are ready to take a break from romantic love. u know what i disagree.
i think i am so not ready to take a break from romantic love. im such a romantic, i fucking romanticize everything so how the fuck can i take a break from romantic love. how can i take a break from romantic love when my girlfriend gives me entries every night. tell me the fuck how. anyway, being with u made me realize how much i love being a romantic n also made me realize that i do like romantic gestures as much as ive buried it deep somewhere, its showing up again and i just have so many things that i want to do for you so u never question my love for u.
i am not ready for a break in romantic love. being with you, that just feels impossible.
if i was there, i would be jetlagged so i would walk to the market every morning before u wake up and get you flowers n bagets n lots of bread and make you coffee with a cute tiny splash of milk or creamer if they have a fukin creamer, and maybe make u some eggs too, n i would let u win at that ball game everytime we play bcs obviously i would win and u would be pissed if i kept on winning, i would make sure u get good cuddles every night, i would learn how to make good mussels and oysters n burgers n pizza n fritata from ur dad so i can make it to u n i would drink all ur shit drinks and get drunk with you n take videos of u and pictures of u n i would also make u cum every morning so u start the day off right anyway i just love being a romantic and i am definitely not ready to take a break from romantic love. so i love u michaela :)

      <h5>yk its still trippy to me sometimes that we're living in such different like lives n places like ure waking up in france surrounded by fucking magical fucking trees and shit eating bagets n bread and im just here chilling with work n it's just like we're such on opposite ends of the spectrum but the wild thing is like i love this contrast. like whenever i see u just out there living ur life it reminds me of just things i always forget like yk it's okay to literally just live its ok to not always be in grind mode and just seeing u enjoy yourself doesnt make me feel left behind, it actually makes feel more grounded yk like ur joy gives me permission to soften. i think this just takes me back again to how having u in my life like uve made me think about balance and u also remind me that pushing is good but so is a good pause yk that i dont have to earn the rest. so i guess knowing u in this short time n loving you has changed the way i look at my own life and i really fucking like it cus u lowk be dropping insightful shit thas why i need u to yap more so im just grateful that someone like u exist in this world and like my fucking girlfriend and i just am happy to get to be here seeing u live ur life anyway thats the tangent i love u :)

      <h5>going back to my horoscopie bestie, they said to "say no" <p>
		honestly, im so glad i didnt. so glad i didnt say no to u.<p>
		so fucking glad i didnt talk myself out of this and out of us. because if i knew back then what i know now, if i knew how warm it feels to love u this much, how stupidly happy i get just hearing ur laugh and watching u crash out over arsenal and england, how safe i feel just knowing you're in my life, i wouldve fuckin slapped myself for even fuckin hesitating this for a second.<p>
	i think back to all the excuses i was making because of how afraid i was to feel. and it's crazy to think that i was that close of missing you entirely. i wudve hated myself if id kept on lying and kept on pretending that i didnt care about you. that i wouldnt care if u went back to london fully fuckin like fucking every walking being. but i did care. and i fucking still do care. i just really care a lot about you and now i know so im just so happy that i said yes to you ya :) i love u michaela my girlfriend :)

      <h5>so apparently my horoscope said i’m gonna keep getting heartbroken over and over. and it kinda stuck with me lowk just cus i lowk just always have that fear in the back of my mind lmaoooo i’ve always been aware of it especially when i start caring deeply like too deep about u. the more i like you, the more that little voice in my head starts preparing for the worst lowk not because i think you’ll hurt me or anything, but just because i know what it feels like to lose something good and sometimes it pops in my brain... like how much i actually like you. how i catch myself being softer n like more vulnerable or just more in it buuut here’s the thing right i think if one day this did make me really sad like really hurt like i’d still be okay i mean obv not but in the sense that i’d know it was something worth feeling. like that i’d do it all again, not because i enjoy pain fcking obv but because as uve said yk its not really living if ure not fully feeling everything n u just feel like that soooo conclusion is i just want to be present with you because ure the one thing that makes sense and ure just the most human humans get and ure just a fucking cute night lamp yk like a cute yellow night lamp so  i just want to keep choosing you every day n as long as i can :)) and i fully cant wait to see u i fucking love you michaela :)))))))))))
