  	     <h5>im gonna go back to my horoscopie bestie again cus i always do this anyway in the morning so i'll just do this for now because it's nice so it said u are ready to take a break from romantic love. u know what i disagree.
i think i am so not ready to take a break from romantic love. im such a romantic, i fucking romanticize everything so how the fuck can i take a break from romantic love. how can i take a break from romantic love when my girlfriend gives me entries every night. tell me the fuck how. anyway, being with u made me realize how much i love being a romantic n also made me realize that i do like romantic gestures as much as ive buried it deep somewhere, its showing up again and i just have so many things that i want to do for you so u never question my love for u.
i am not ready for a break in romantic love. being with you, that just feels impossible.
if i was there, i would be jetlagged so i would walk to the market every morning before u wake up and get you flowers n bagets n lots of bread and make you coffee with a cute tiny splash of milk or creamer if they have a fukin creamer, and maybe make u some eggs too, n i would let u win at that ball game everytime we play bcs obviously i would win and u would be pissed if i kept on winning, i would make sure u get good cuddles every night, i would learn how to make good mussels and oysters n burgers n pizza n fritata from ur dad so i can make it to u n i would drink all ur shit drinks and get drunk with you n take videos of u and pictures of u n i would also make u cum every morning so u start the day off right anyway i just love being a romantic and i am definitely not ready to take a break from romantic love. so i love u michaela :)
