      <h4>july 8 2025</h4>
    fully i know what today entry is gna be. is just about how i like u and how u operate as a person u know i think u dont realize how much light n happiness u bring to ppl and just i dont even know how to describe it. like i was thinking abt it the other day and like fully thinking u only getting 5 hours of sleep and u still doing all shit with kevin for the whole day bcs he's visiting and ofc u wanna spend time w me but u still always try to be up for me n like when u wake up in the morning u never ever like even joke about blaming me for being tired or not getting enough sleep like that shit kinda baffles me to be honest and i just think about how positive u actually are as a person and ure just like theres so many layers to ur emotions and how u carry urself and its just very admirable honestly for me but just want u to know u that ill be here whatever mood ure in n ure just honestly u just have a wild brain and i so love u for it.
